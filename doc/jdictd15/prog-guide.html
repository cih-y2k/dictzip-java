<h2>JDICT - A Java library for accessing electronic dictionaries</h2>

<h3>The DICT format</h3>
<p>Many electronic dictionaries are available for several languages. A common format for electronic dictionaries is the format used by the DICT
protocol (http://www.dict.org). JDICT is a Java library used for accessing
dictionary databases stored in that format.</p>
<p>The DICT format is defined as follows. A database consists of two files. One is a flat text file, the other in the
index. The flat text file contains dictionary entries (or any other suitable
data), and the index contains tab-delimited tuples consisting of the headword,
the byte offset at which this entry begins in the flat text file, and the length
of the entry in bytes. The offset and length are encoded using base 64 encoding
using the 64 characters:</p>
<p>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/</p>
<p>(A=0, B=1, ..., 9=61, +=62, /=63. For example, 9Ca = 61 * 64^2 + 2 * 64^1 + 26)</p>
<p>Encoding numbers in base 64 saves considerable space when compared with
the usual base 10 encoding, while still permitting tab characters (ASCII 9) to
be used for delimiting fields in a record. Each record ends with a newline
(ASCII 10), so the index file is human readable.</p>
<h3>Basic functionalities of JDICT</h3>

<p>Given a headword, JDICT performs a search for that word on the index file. If
the word is found, it gets the position POS and the length LEN of the
corresponding entry (from the index file) and returns LEN bytes from the data
file, starting at position POS. Moreover, it also returns a list of headwords
that are located near the given word in the index file. If no exact match is
found, only the list of adjacent headwords is returned. The client can process
that list further, e.g. to get a list of prefix matches.</p>

<p>Additionally, JDICT offers the possibility of looking up by position. A
client can request the nth entry of a certain dictionary. This is particularly
useful when the client has requested a word and now wants to browse
backward/forward (to see the previous/next entries). </p>

<h3>How to use JDICT</h3>
<p>The central component of JDICT is the interface org.dict.kernel.IDatabase. It
represents a single dictionary and offers the API to look for an entry by
headword or by position. To be able to use several databases at the same time,
the interface org.dict.kernel.IDictEngine is defined that basically groups
together some
dictionaries.</p>
<p>The typical usage of JDICT is as follows:</p>

<pre>/* cfg is the name (String) of a configuration file, discussed later */
org.dict.kernel.IDictEngine e =
  org.dict.server.DatabaseFactory.getEngine(cfg);
while (true) {
  /* receive from client a request which contains the query String:
   db=dbID&amp;word=headword or db=ibID&amp;pos=N. Create an IRequest
   object and pass it to the lookup method */
  org.dict.kernel.IRequest req =
    new org.dict.kernel.SimpleRequest(requestURI, queryString);
  org.dict.kernel.IAnswer[] arr = e.lookup(req);
  /* do something with the answers */
}

</pre>

<h3>Parameter passing</h3>
<p>A request to the IEngine object is encapsulated in an IRequest object. The
API of that interface is as follows:</p>

<pre>public interface org.dict.kernel.IRequest {
    public String getParameter(java.lang.String);
    public String[] getParameterValues(java.lang.String);
    public String getRequestURI();
}
</pre>

<p>JDICT provides a default implementation of IRequest: org.dict.kernel.SimpleRequest.
We create a SimpleRequest object by using the constructor: new
SimpleRequest(requestURI, queryString). The parameter requestURI is a String
which is returned when the method getRequestURI() is called (e.g., the path to
the CGI script, can be the empty String &quot;&quot;). queryString has the same format as
a CGI query String: param1=value1&amp;param2=value2&amp;....&nbsp; Calling
getParameter(param1) returns value1 etc. By default, org.dict.kernel.IEngine
uses the following the parameters:</p>

<menu>
  <li>db (e.g., db=wn): the ID of the dictionary to use. There are two special
  dictionaries * (all) and ! (any). If the value of the parameter db is null, *
  is assumed. If db is *, all dictionaries will be used to look for a word. If
  db is !, the first definition is returned. </li>
  <li>word (e.g., word=river): the headword to search for</li>
  <li>pos (e.g., pos=365): the position of the entry to be returned (first entry
  is numbered 0)</li>
</menu>

<p>Either word or pos must be used, but not both.</p>

<h3>Database configuration file</h3>

<p>A  configuration file contains information about certain dictionary databases.
It typically looks as follows:</p>

<pre># Configuration for WordNet
wn.data=wn.dict.dz
wn.index=wn.index
wn.morph=org.dict.kernel.EnglishMorphAnalyzer
wn.html=vietdict.server.WordnetPrinter

# Configuration for FolDoc
fd.data=foldoc.dict.dz
fd.index=foldoc.index
fd.morph=org.dict.kernel.EnglishMorphAnalyzer
fd.name=Computing Dictionary
fd.encoding=latin1

</pre>

<p>Lines beginning with # are comments. There are two mandatory entries: db.data and db.index specify the location of
the data and the index file for the database db. A number of optional
configurable properties are supported:</p>

<menu>
  <li>db.name: the database name</li>
  <li>db.encoding: encoding of the database (default: UTF-8)</li>
  <li>db.morph: the morphological function used to detect variations of a word.
  For example, if EnglishMorphAnalyzer is used, one can look for &quot;detects&quot; (that
  is not in the dictionary) and get the base form &quot;detect&quot; </li>
  <li>db.html: the HTML formatter for the output. When the client receives the
  entries from the dictionary, it may use an HTML formatter to generate nice
  HTML output for displaying the entry in some browser.</li>
</menu>

<h3>JDictd - The Java implementation of the DICT protocol</h3>
<p>JDictd implements the DICT server protocol (RFC2229). It uses the JDICT
library to access dictionary databases. Besides RFC2229, JDictd also implements
the HTTP protocol, so the server can be accessed using a DICT client, or any Web
browser.</p>

<h3>The Dict Servlet</h3>

If you run a servlet container (Jakarta Tomcat, WebSphere, WebLogic...) and want to
run the dictionary server in that container, you can use the servlet
<code>org.dict.server.DictServlet</code> for that purpose. This servlet class
uses one initialisation parameter, <code>config</code>, which points to the
configuration file for the databases. (Unlike the JDictd server which reads
several dictionary configuration files on the command line, the servlet reads
only one configuration file, so the configuration for all databases must go there).

<p>

A sample <code>web.xml</code> file is included in the distribution. If you install
DictServlet in an web application called <code>dict</code>, you can access the dictionaries
at the URL <code>http://localhost:8080/dict</code>, provided that your servlet engine listens
on port 8080. The value <code>data/dict.ini</code> of the init-parameter <code>config</code>
means that your configuration file resides in the subdirectory <code>data/</code> of your
web application directory (normally <code>webapps/dict/</code>).
